# Exam Tips
- **Diagnostic logic:** Symptom → Component → Tool → Procedure/Spec  
- **Verification:** Verify concern / road test → research TSBs, recalls, ADAS  
- **No-start strategy:** Fuel → Ignition → Spark → Compression  
- **Hybrid/HEV:** Follow high-voltage disconnect and safety procedures  
- Know which **tool is BEST** for a given symptom.
- ASE emphasizes **diagnosis**, not rebuild procedures.
- Match **tool → measurement → diagnosis**.
- Machine-shop tools are tested by **results**, not operation.
- Always choose the **most accurate tool**, not the fastest one.

# Theory
- **BTCD**: (6degress-12degrees) Before Top Dead Center for spark plug to ignite fuel for comporesion
- **DTC:** Diagnostic trouble code
- **GDI:** Gasoline Direct Injection
- **TDC (Top Dead Center):** The point at which the piston is at the highest position in the cylinder. Used for timing and measurements.  
- **BDC (Bottom Dead Center):** The point at which the piston is at the lowest position in the cylinder.  
- **Compression Stroke:** The stroke where the piston moves upward with both intake and exhaust valves closed, compressing the air-fuel mixture.  
- **Power Stroke:** The stroke where the spark ignites the compressed mixture, forcing the piston downward.  
- **Intake Stroke:** The piston moves down with the intake valve open, drawing the air-fuel mixture into the cylinder.  
- **Exhaust Stroke:** The piston moves up with the exhaust valve open, pushing burnt gases out of the cylinder.  
- **Firing Order:** The sequence in which each cylinder receives spark and fires, critical for smooth engine operation.  
- **Stroke:** The distance the piston travels from TDC to BDC.  
- **Bore:** The diameter of the cylinder.  
- **Deck Height / Deck Clearance:** The distance from the piston crown to the deck surface when the piston is at TDC.  
- **Compression Ratio:** The ratio of cylinder volume at BDC to cylinder volume at TDC.  
- **Valve Overlap:** The period when both intake and exhaust valves are slightly open at the same time, allowing better cylinder scavenging.  
- **Dead Center (DC):** Either TDC or BDC; reference points for engine timing and measurement.  
- **Piston Stroke Direction:** Up = compression/exhaust, Down = intake/power.  
- **Intake/Exhaust Valve Timing:** Refers to when the valves open and close relative to piston position and crankshaft rotation.  
- **Frictional Losses:** Resistance from moving parts such as piston skirts, bearings, and rings, affecting engine efficiency.  
- **Volumetric Efficiency:** The measure of how effectively the engine fills its cylinders with air-fuel mixture.  
- **Crank Angle:** The rotation angle of the crankshaft, often used to define piston position relative to TDC/BDC.  
- **Camshaft Lobe:** The raised portion of a camshaft that pushes the valve open.  
- **Compression Pressure:** Pressure in the cylinder at the end of the compression stroke; used in diagnostics.  
- **Leak-Down:** A test that measures percentage of leakage in a cylinder, indicating worn rings, valves, or head gasket issues.  
- **Firing / Ignition Timing:** The point in crankshaft rotation when the spark plug fires relative to TDC.  
- **Boots:** Pressure above atmospheric

# No-Start Troubleshooting
## 1. Spark (Ignition)
**Why first:**  
Spark is the easiest to check quickly with a spark tester or scan tool. If there’s no spark, the engine won’t run regardless of fuel or compression.
**Checks include:**  
- Spark at the plugs (using a spark tester)  
- Ignition coil operation (COP/DIS systems)  
- Crankshaft position sensor (CKP) and wiring  
- Distributor/timing (on older engines)  

## 2. Fuel
**Why second:**  
If spark is good, the next common cause of a no-start is fuel delivery.
**Checks include:**  
- Fuel pressure (fuel pressure gauge at the rail)  
- Fuel injector pulse (Noid light or scan tool)  
- Fuel pump operation and relays/fuses  
- Clogged filter or restricted lines  

## 3. Compression
**Why last:**  
If spark and fuel are both correct, the problem is likely mechanical (low compression or internal engine issue). Compression tests are more time-consuming and require removing spark plugs.
**Checks include:**  
- Dry compression test (all cylinders)  
- Wet compression test (add oil to differentiate worn rings vs. leaking valves)  
- Leak-down test (to pinpoint leakage source: valves, rings, or head gasket)
